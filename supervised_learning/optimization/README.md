# Optimization

## Tasks:

### 0. Normalization Constants:
Write the function `def normalization_constants(X):` that calculates the normalization (standardization) constants of a matrix:
* `X` is the `numpy.ndarray` of shape (`m`, `nx`) to normalize
  * `m` is the number of data points
  * `nx` is the number of features
* Returns: the mean and standard deviation of each feature, respectively

### 1. Normalize:
Write the function def normalize(`X`, `m`, `s`): that normalizes (standardizes) a matrix:
* `X` is the `numpy.ndarray` of shape (`d`, `nx`) to normalize
  * `d` is the number of data points
  * `nx` is the number of features
* `m` is a `numpy.ndarray` of shape (`nx`,) that contains the mean of all features of `X`
* `s` is a `numpy.ndarray` of shape (`nx`,) that contains the standard deviation of all features of `X`
* Returns: The normalized `X` matrix
