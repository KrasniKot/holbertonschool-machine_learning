# Optimization

## Tasks:

### 0. Normalization Constants:
Write the function `def normalization_constants(X):` that calculates the normalization (standardization) constants of a matrix:
* `X` is the `numpy.ndarray` of shape (`m`, `nx`) to normalize
  * `m` is the number of data points
  * `nx` is the number of features
* Returns: the mean and standard deviation of each feature, respectively
