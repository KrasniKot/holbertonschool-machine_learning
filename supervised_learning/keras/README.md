# Keras

## Tasks:

### 0. Sequential:
Write a function `def build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob):` that builds a neural network with the Keras library:
nx is the number of input features to the network
layers is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
activations is a list containing the activation functions used for each layer of the network
lambtha is the L2 regularization parameter
keep_prob is the probability that a node will be kept for dropout
You are not allowed to use the Input class
Returns: the keras model

### 1. Input:
Write a function def build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob): that builds a neural network with the Keras library:
nx is the number of input features to the network
layers is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
activations is a list containing the activation functions used for each layer of the network
lambtha is the L2 regularization parameter
keep_prob is the probability that a node will be kept for dropout
You are not allowed to use the Sequential class
Returns: the keras model

### 2. Optimize:
Write a function def optimize_model(network, alpha, beta1, beta2): that sets up Adam optimization for a keras model with categorical crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics:
network is the model to optimize
alpha is the learning rate
beta1 is the first Adam optimization parameter
beta2 is the second Adam optimization parameter
Returns: None
