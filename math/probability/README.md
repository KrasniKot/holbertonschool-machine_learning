# Probability

## Tasks:

### 0. Initialize Poisson:
Create a class ``Poisson`` that represents a poisson distribution:

Class contructor ``def __init__(self, data=None, lambtha=1.):``
- ``data`` is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
- ``lambtha`` is the expected number of occurences in a given time frame
- Sets the instance attribute ``lambtha``
  - Saves ``lambtha`` as a ``float``
- If ``data`` is not given, (i.e. None (be careful: not data has not the same result as data is None)):
  - Use the given ``lambtha``
  - If ``lambtha`` is not a positive value or equals to 0, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``lambtha must be a positive value``
- If data is given:
  - Calculate the ``lambtha`` of ``data``
  - If ``data`` is not a list, raise a ``TypeError`` with the ``message data must be a list``
  - If ``data`` does not contain at least two data points, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``data must contain multiple values``

- If ``data`` is given:
  - Calculate the ``lambtha`` of ``data``
  - If ``data`` is not a ``list``, raise a ``TypeError`` with the message ``data must be a list``
  - If ``data`` does not contain at least two data points, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``data must contain multiple values``

### 4. Exponential PDF

- Instance method ``def pdf(self, x):``
- Calculates the value of the PDF for a given time period
- ``x`` is the time period
- Returns the PDF value for ``x``
- If ``x`` is out of range, return 0

### 5. Exponential CDF
Update the class ``Exponential``:

- Instance method ``def cdf(self, x):``
- Calculates the value of the CDF for a given time period
- ``x`` is the time period
- Returns the CDF value for ``x``
- If ``x`` is out of range, return 0

### 6. Initialize Normal:
Create a class ``Normal`` that represents a normal distribution:

Class contructor ``def __init__(self, data=None, mean=0., stddev=1.):``
- ``data`` is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
- ``mean`` is the mean of the distribution
- ``stddev`` is the standard deviation of the distribution
- Sets the instance attributes mean and ``stddev``
  - Saves mean and ``stddev`` as floats
- If data is not given (i.e. None (be careful: not data has not the same result as data is None))
  - Use the given mean and ``stddev``
  - If ``stddev`` is not a positive value or equals to 0, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``stddev must be a positive value``
- If ``data`` is given:
  - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of ``data``
  - If ``data`` is not a ``list``, raise a ``TypeError`` with the message ``data must be a list``
  - If ``data`` does not contain at least two data points, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``data must contain multiple values``

### 7. Normalize Normal:
Update the class ``Normal``:

- Instance method ``def z_score(self, x):``
  - Calculates the z-score of a given x-value
  - ``x`` is the x-value
  - Returns the z-score of ``x``
- Instance method ``def x_value(self, z):``
  - Calculates the x-value of a given z-score
  - ``z`` is the z-score
  - Returns the x-value of z

### 8. Normal PDF:

- Instance method ``def cdf(self, x):``
- Calculates the value of the CDF for a given x-value
- ``x`` is the x-value
- Returns the CDF value for ``x``

### 10. Initialize Binomial:
Create a class Binomial that represents a binomial distribution:

- Class contructor ``def __init__(self, data=None, n=1, p=0.5):``
- ``data`` is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
- ``n`` is the number of Bernoulli trials
- ``p`` is the probability of a “success”
- Sets the instance attributes ``n`` and ``p``
- Saves ``n`` as an integer and ``p`` as a float
- If ``data`` is not given (i.e. ``None``)
- Use the given ``n`` and ``p``
  - If ``n`` is not a positive value, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``n must be a positive value``
  - If ``p`` is not a valid probability, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``p must be greater than 0 and less than 1``
- If ``data`` is given:
  - Calculate ``n`` and ``p`` from ``data``
  - Round ``n`` to the nearest integer (rounded, not casting! The difference is important: int(3.7) is not the same as round-(3.7))
  - Hint: Calculate ``p`` first and then calculate ``n``. Then recalculate ``p``. Think about why you would want to do it this way?
  - If ``data`` is not a ``list``, raise a ``TypeError`` with the message ``data must be a list``
  - If ``data`` does not contain at least two data points, raise a ``ValueError`` with the message ``data must contain multiple values``

- ``k`` is the number of “successes”
- If ``k`` is not an integer, convert it to an integer
- If ``k`` is out of range, return 0
- Returns the CDF value for ``k``
- Hint: use the pmf method
