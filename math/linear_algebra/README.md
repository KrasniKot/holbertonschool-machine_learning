# Linear Algebra

## Tasks

### 0. Slice Me Up:
Complete the following source code (found below):
- `arr1` should be the first two numbers of `arr`
- `arr2` should be the last five numbers of `arr`
- `arr3` should be the 2nd through 6th numbers of `arr`
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
- Your program should be exactly 8 lines

### 1. Trim Me Down:
Complete the following source code (found below):
- `the_middle` should be a 2D matrix containing the 3rd and 4th columns of `matrix`
- You are not allowed to use any conditional statements
- You are only allowed to use one `for` loop
- Your program should be exactly 6 lines

### 2. Size Me Please:
Write a function `def matrix_shape(matrix):` that calculates the shape of a matrix:
- You can assume all elements in the same dimension are of the same type/shape
- The shape should be returned as a list of integers

### 3. Flip Me Over:
Write a function `def matrix_transpose(matrix):` that returns the transpose of a 2D matrix, `matrix`:
- You must return a new matrix
- You can assume that `matrix` is never empty
- You can assume all elements in the same dimension are of the same type/shape

### 4. Line Up:
Write a function `def add_arrays(arr1, arr2):` that adds two arrays element-wise:
- You can assume that `arr1` and `arr2` are lists of ints/floats
- You must return a new list
- If `arr1` and `arr2` are not the same shape, return `None`

### 5. Across The Planes:
Write a function `def add_matrices2D(mat1, mat2):` that adds two matrices element-wise:
- You can assume that `mat1` and `mat2` are 2D matrices containing ints/floats
- You can assume all elements in the same dimension are of the same type/shape
- You must return a new matrix
- If `mat1` and `mat2` are not the same shape, return `None`
